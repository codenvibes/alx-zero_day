# **0x03. Git**
This repository documents my responses to the "**0x03. Git**" project tasks. 

# Notes:
- **Linus Torvalds** created the Linux kernel and originally authored Git.
- **Git** is an open-source cloud-based version control system, and **GitHub** is an online service that hosts Git repositories. 
- Git is Version Control System: A Version Control System records the changes made to code over time in a special database called a repository.  
- Version Control systems allow us to track project history and work together.
